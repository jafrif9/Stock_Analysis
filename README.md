# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The overall essence of the project was to create a VBA module that could filter through a given dataset and analyze its contents.

### Purpose
The purpose of the challenge was to use VBA to create a general code that would filter through various stocks in a given year. The code was then expected to give an output of each stock's daily volume and percent increase or decrease in said year. The final output was required to be formatted appropriately for ease in reading.

## Results

### Stock Performance Between 2017 and 2018
Upon initial observation, it can be seen that stocks in 2017 had a better performance, as eleven out of twelve of the stocks being analyzed had a positive return (see image below). In addition, four of the twelve stocks gave a return of greater than 100%.

When looking at the data for 2018, it can be seen that only two out of the twelve stocks being analyzed had a positive return, with the remaining ten having a negative return. In addition, the stocks with a positive return did not excede 100%, unlike the stocks in 2017 (image of 2018 stocks below).

By analyzing the performance of the same twelve stocks in both 2017 and 2018, it can be said that the specified stocks had a better performance in 2017.
