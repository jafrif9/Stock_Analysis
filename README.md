# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The overall essence of the project was to create a VBA module that could filter through a given dataset and analyze its contents.

### Purpose
The purpose of the challenge was to use VBA to create a general code that would filter through various stocks in a given year. The code was then expected to give an output of each stock's daily volume and percent increase or decrease in said year. The final output was required to be formatted appropriately for ease in reading.
